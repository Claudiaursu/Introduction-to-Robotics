## Title: Air Drums
### Demo Video

### How to play
The main purpose of this project is to make sounds easily and in a funny and flexible way, using the 2 drum sticks. The idea is to be able to play these drums without having to hit something with the two sticks. In this way, we can play the drums "in air", just like the project title says! All the player needs to do is to move quickly the sticks in the air, just like he would do with some real drums, having to hit something. The concept of hitting "the air" offers the music lovers the chance to sing something in an unusual and simple way. The player can move the sticks up or down, left or right, or in any direction he wants, and the sounds will be played as soon as the movement is detected. The person using my project won't be limited only to the down direction(as like the real drums), he has the flexibility to "hit" anywhere he wants, the only condition is to move quickly to that direction.
There are 2 different sounds the player can generate by movement, each one of them for each stick.
