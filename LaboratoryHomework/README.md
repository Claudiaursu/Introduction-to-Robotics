# Laboratory Homeworks:

### 1st Homework:
File name: 3_potentiometers_RGB: I have used a RGB Led and 3 potentiometers and connected them together in order to be able to change the intensity of each colour(red,green and blue) through potentiometers. In this way we are able to create any colour we want, as a combination of the these three colours, each of them at the desired intensity.

### 2nd Homework:
File name: knockDetectorBuzzers: The passive buzzer detects the knock and after 5 seconds the active buzzer will start playing a tone which can be stopped only by pressing the pushbutton.

### 3rd Homework:
File name: joystick4digit7segment: With a joystick we can control each digit shown on a 4 digit 7 segment display. We can move through the 4 digits and by pressing the joystick we can select which one we want to modify, and then press again the joystick to move and modify another digit.

### 4th Homework:
File name: Game_menu : With a joystick we can move through the menu and select one of the 3 available options(Play, HighScore, Settings).
From the Settings we can change the starting level. In the HighScore section we can see the biggest score. When we select Play, the score and the level are displayed and after 10 seconds, a message appears. A video that shows how this homework works can be found here:
